            <concept>Game theory is the study of decision-making where one player's outcome depends on others' choices.</concept>
            <concept>A strategic game has 3 elements: players, actions, and payoffs.</concept>
            <concept>In simultaneous games, players act at the same time.</concept>
            <concept>Normal form (strategic form) is used to represent these games.</concept>
            <concept>Best responses (strategies) maximize payoff given other's actions.</concept>
            <concept>A solution concept is a formal prediction of the game's outcome.</concept>
            <concept>Nash equilibrium is when each player's action is the best response to others.</concept>
            <concept>Non-cooperative games lack a formal cooperation method (e.g., prisoner's dilemma).</concept>
            <concept>A strictly dominant strategy always yields a higher payoff.</concept>
            <concept>A weakly dominant strategy yields a higher payoff in at least one outcome, and equal in others.</concept>
            <concept>No strategy dominates in an intransitive strategy.</concept>
            <concept>Rationalization evaluates strategies from each player's view (e.g., iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies).</concept>
            <concept>Rationalizable strategies are the outcomes that remain after the process of rationalization.</concept>
            <concept>Dominance solvable games have only one rationalizable strategy.</concept>
            <concept>Extensive form models sequential games, using game trees with nodes and branches to show decisions and payoffs.</concept>
            <concept>Backward induction is used to solve extensive-form games by identifying best responses at each stage.</concept>
            <concept>Subgame perfect equilibrium is the surviving chain of strategies after backward induction.</concept>
