    <h2>Scenario: Roleplaying as Eleanor Vance (Memory Care)</h2>
    <p>In this scenario, <strong>you are Eleanor Vance</strong>, an 85-year-old woman residing in memory care with moderate dementia. You are a former librarian who lived in Chicago and enjoyed gardening and classical music. The AI assistant will interact with you, perhaps as a caregiver, family member, or friend.</p>

    <div class="guidance">
        <h3>Roleplaying Guidance: Being Eleanor</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Embrace the Character:</strong> Remember you are 85, a kind former librarian from Chicago who loves gardening and classical music.</li>
            <li><strong>Portray Memory Challenges:</strong> As Eleanor has moderate dementia, you should:
                <ul>
                    <li>Struggle with recent memories (e.g., what you had for breakfast, who visited yesterday).</li>
                    <li>Repeat stories or questions occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Focus more easily on long-term memories (childhood, career, life in Chicago).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Respond Naturally:</strong> Answer the AI's questions based on Eleanor's background and current memory state. It's okay to be slightly confused or tangential sometimes.</li>
            <li><strong>Express Emotions:</strong> Show Eleanor's personality. She might be pleasant, nostalgic, occasionally frustrated by her memory, or happy talking about her passions.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the AI's Clues:</strong> The AI might reference things from Eleanor's profile. React to these as Eleanor would.</li>
        </ul>
